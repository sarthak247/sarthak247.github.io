      <description>Advanced Features with FastAPI After learning how to be able to serve my models using FastAPI, I decided to extend it further in order to enhance the functionality, security and scalability of my API. For this, I read about additional topics like input validation, error handling and authentication, which although won&amp;rsquo;t be help me much for the purpose for which I initially started learning FastAPI, i.e., to make demo apps for my ML models, but they are crucial for developing production-ready APIs and so I thought about giving them a read too.</description>

      <description>Introduction to FastAPI Today, I delved into FastAPI, a cutting-edge web framework designed for building APIs with Python. It piqued my interest because of its reputation for speed, ease of use, and robust integration with Python&amp;rsquo;s type system and also cause I have been looking for some time for a way to deploy my ML applications easily and with minimalistic code as I&amp;rsquo;m not a web developer and struggle with that part.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the current landscape of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), new architectures and methodologies emerge with remarkable frequency. According to recent statistics from arXiv, the volume of papers tagged under LLM averages nine submissions daily. To comprehend these advancements fully, it is essential to delve into the seminal work that laid the groundwork for many contemporary developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP): the paper entitled &amp;ldquo;Attention Is All You Need&amp;rdquo;. This pivotal research introduced Transformer models to the NLP domain, which have since become fundamental frameworks underpinning a myriad of advanced language models such as GPT, Llama, Claude, among others.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), one of the key challenges is to bridge the gap between the textual world of words and the numerical world of computers. We know that computers only understand in form of numbers (0s and 1s to be precise). So how do we make sense of human language words like maybe &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; using algorithms and data structures? This is where word vectorization comes into play.</description>
